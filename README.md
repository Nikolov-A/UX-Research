## Project - *Velvet Design Logo*

Velvet Design is a digital marketing agency that has created a logo in different colors and wanted to find out which is the most liked color by its customers.

For this purpose, I used **`Coomb's "A theory of data" -> Preferential Choice: Unfolding technique -> Pair comparison data`** and performed **`Multidimensional Scaling`** in **`STATISTICA`** to analyze results.

**I will give a very brief example of how the theory works without going into great detail.**  
  

Let's imagine that we are producers of chocolate candies.   
Usually, chocolate is made from quantitative properties such as cocoa butter, sugar, milk, and others.  
It is natural to be interested in how to combine these features so that our customers like them. Whether to use 20 or 10 grams of sugar, whether to use 50 or 36.5 milliliters of milk and so on.  
Let's decide to make 10 candies with different amounts of their ingredients and give them to our consumers to try. We give them two candies, to compare which one is better, then another two and so on till all candies being evaluated. 

By recording their answers, Coombs' theory allows us to assess which characteristics of the candies are important, are taken into account by our customers, and even more, we can evaluate the customer's ideal on this characteristic.  

For example, for person X we can say that he loves candy with 12 grams of sugar, 14.5 milliliters of milk, and 79 grams of cocoa butter, moreover without creating in advance exactly such a candy with these characteristics. 


**Here we can see a very simple geometric interpretation of the model.**
