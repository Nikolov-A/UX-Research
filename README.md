## *Velvet Design Logo*

Velvet Design is a digital marketing agency that has created a logo in different colors and wanted to find out which is the most liked color by its customers.

For this purpose, I used **`Coomb's "A theory of data" -> Preferential Choice: Unfolding technique -> Pair comparison data`** and performed **`Multidimensional Scaling`** in **`STATISTICA`** to analyze results.

**I will give a very brief example of how the theory works without going into great detail.**  
  

Let's imagine that we are producers of chocolate candies.   
Usually, chocolate is made from quantitative properties such as cocoa butter, sugar, milk, and others.  
It is natural to be interested in how to combine these features so that our customers like them. Whether to use 20 or 10 grams of sugar, whether to use 50 or 36.5 milliliters of milk and so on.  
Let's decide to make 10 candies with different amounts of their ingredients and give them to our consumers to try. We give them two candies, to compare which one is better, then another two and so on till all candies being evaluated. 

By recording their answers, Coombs' theory allows us to assess which characteristics of the candies are important, are taken into account by our customers, and even more, we can evaluate the customer's ideal on this characteristic.  

For example, for person X we can say that he loves candy with 12 grams of sugar, 14.5 milliliters of milk, and 79 grams of cocoa butter, moreover without creating in advance exactly such a candy with these characteristics. 


**Here we can see a very simple geometric interpretation of the model.**

**Legend:**

Along the X axis we have sugar  
Along the Y axis we have cocoa butter   
Along the Z axis we have milk  
 

**A** - candy № 1  
**B** - candy № 2  
**C** - candy № 3  

**I1** - The perfect candy for a subject № 1  
**I2** - The perfect candy for a subject № 2






**Let's get back to Velvet Design Logo.**

In this case, we can replace sugar, cocoa butter and milk with the color characteristics of hue, saturation and brightness (value).

## *Ring, Gum and Photo Frame* 

Here I used the same approach as described above and I had to answer which angle is the most liked one.

## *Effect of congruency between website content and advertising content on banner blindness (Eye-tracking study)*

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/py9qXXn/download.png" /> 

I should answer which ad positions is driving more attention and what ad content (congruency or incongruence) is driving more attention. So I used eye tracker – **`Tobi I TX 300`** with **`Tobi I Studio 3.3.0`** to analyze fixation count and total fixation duration on these green fields and performed **`2x2 ANOVA`** to analyze results.


Eye tracking is a sensor technology that makes it possible for a computer or other device to know where a person is looking. An eye tracker can detect the presence, attention and focus of the user. It allows for unique insights into human behavior and facilitates natural user interfaces in a broad range of devices. The ability to control a computer using the eyes is also vital for people who are unable to speak or use their hands.  

This is how Eye Tracker looks like.
